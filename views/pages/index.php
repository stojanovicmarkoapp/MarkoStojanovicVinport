                <p class="blackColor text-justify">Vinport is a non-profit making organization that bases its activity on its specialized site intended as a free database to help all fans of vintage cars to quickly and easily find all the information they are interested in. The word Vinport is a portmanteau coined from the words vintage and report. The non-profit making organization Vinport was founded in May 2000 and soon posted initially collected reports on vintage cars on its website. Vinport staff members are enthusiasts who work hard on their reports in their free time to make them relevant and accessible to everyone in one place. For this purpose, they visit car museums and collectors, many of whom are part of our staff or community. All of our reports have accurate information and illustrations with respect to the detailed control of everything we publish by the diligent staff of our non-profit making organization. Over time, Vinport's website has become one of the most reliable sources of information on vintage cars on the Internet.</p>

                <p class="lightYellowColor text-justify">Our mission is to function as an online database of classic cars whose data will be available to everyone completely free of charge. We want to bring these cars closer to people so that they understand them as silent witnesses of long-gone times. Although they have long been outdated and obsolete for function of means of transportation, over time they have been given the function of a link to the past and this function makes them more important than they have ever been. The non-profit making organization Vinport believes that destroying or leaving to the tooth of time of an individual vintage car is a loss of an individual link to the past and that each one of them is a piece of history for itself and that by preserving them we preserve the memory of the past times. We see ourselves as the most visited site on the topic of vintage cars on the Internet as well as the first choice of all those who need certain information about them either out of curiosity or more practical reasons.</p>

                <p class="blackColor text-justify">The non-profit making organization Vinport believes that a period of 30 years is enough for a car to be considered a classic, and therefore in our reports we process cars produced in epochs of 10 years up to 1989. We do not analyze cars manufactured before 1940 because we take that year as the beginning of the golden age of the automobile industry, which was still in its infancy until then. Vinport's reports include vintage cars from various manufacturers such as Fiat, Lancia, Austin-Healey, Buick, Chevrolet and so forth, from various countries such as Italy, the United Kingdom, the United States and so forth. In the reports, we analyze a specific model in all its variants and do not analyze each version separately because there can be very many of them without a substantial difference between them. In the reports of our non-profit making organization, we summarize information related to each individual variant of the car, whether it is a coupe, sedan, estate wagon or convertible.</p>

                <p class="lightYellowColor text-justify">The non-profit making organization Vinport has no headquarters, but its database is maintained by members of our hardworking staff around the world who tirelessly search for data related to vintage cars, summarizing them in the usable information from which our reports are made. You can also be part of a huge community that extends around the world. All you need to do is to sign up and you will get right to post comments on all of our reports and share your opinion or experience with the rest of the community and our staff. And that's not all, by joining you will be able to help our noble mission much more tangibly by being able to send pictures of vintage cars of which you are the author and thus facilitate the work of making reports to our staff. It would be highly desirable, though not mandatory, to send the name of the car, its epoch and name of manufacturer too in the description fields to help our staff identify the car more easily. But if you don't know that, don't despair, our staff will check the accuracy of your contribution anyway in order to make a reliable product in the form of a report.</p>
